	* Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors <small>Nevirapine, Delavirdine, Efavirenz</small>
	* Nucleotide inhibitors <small>Tenofovir</small>
	* Integrase inhibitior <small>Raltegravir</small> 
	* Protease inhibitors <small> Atazanavir,Saquinavir, Ritonavir, Lopinavir, Indinavir, Nelfinavir </small> 



### Agents for the treatment of virus infections 
* Herpes Simplex Virus and Varicella Zoster Virus
	* <small>Acyclovir, Valacyclovir, Famciclovir, Penciclovir</small>
* Cytomegalovirus
	* <small>Ganciclovir, Valganciclovir, Cidofovir, Foscarnet</small>
* Hepatitis Virus B and C
	* <small> Lamivudine, Adefovir, Interferon alpha, Ribavirin</small>
* Influenza Virus
	* Uncoating inhibitors <small> Amantadine, Rimantadine</small>
	* Viral release inhibitors <small> Zanamivir, Oseltamivir</small>



### Objectives

#### At the completion of this unit, the student should be able to:
1. Recognize the clinical characteristics and goals of therapy for HIV/AIDS
2. Identify the steps in the viral replication process that provide targets for antiviral therapy
3. Recall which drugs act at each of the target steps in the replication process for both RNA and DNA viruses
4. Recall the primary drugs that are effective for each major class of viral infection
5. Describe the mechanism of action and significant pharmacological properties of the five major classes of antiretroviral (anti-HIV) agents



### Objectives (Cont.)

6. Understand the drug interactions involved in multidrug antiretroviral combination therapy and the effect of these antiviral agents on other concurrent drug therapies
7. Understand the basis for the viral selectivity of the antiviral agents
8. Describe the common and unique adverse effects of the distinct classes of antiviral agents
9. Describe the mechanisms of action for HSV, CMV, and HBV antiviral agents and mechanisms of viral resistance to these agents 
10. Identify the significant characteristics of the anti-influenza drugs acting at viral uncoating and release



### AIDS background

1. **Primary infection.** About 90% of patients develop a flu-like illness, which coincides with seroconversion, between 2 and 4 weeks post exposure. Symptoms include, fever, night sweats, sore throat, lymphadenopathy, diarrhea. The illness is self-limiting.
2. **Asymptomatic phase.**  Of variable duration, from 2 to 10 years.  Patients are clinically well, but infectious.
3. **Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS).** Syndrome with the following features:
	* Constitutional disease:  fever, diarrhea, weight loss, skin rashes.
	* Neurological disease: dementia, myelopathy, peripheral neuropathy.
	* Immunodeficiency: increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections.
	* Rare malignancies: Kaposi sarcoma, oral hairy leukoplakia, lymphomas.
