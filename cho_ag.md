Choline esters: Organ system effects 

### Cardiac effects 

* Muscarinic agonists 
	* reduces the rate of diastolic depolarization
		* reduce the heart rate
	* slow conduction of the cardiac action potential
		* increase PR interval 

---

Choline esters: Organ system effects 

### Vascular effects 

* <span id="drug"> Acetylcholine </span> typically causes vasodilation. 
	* mediated by activating muscarinic M3 receptors located in vascular endothelial cells 
		* activation of nitric oxide (NO) synthetase. 
		* NO diffuses into vascular smooth muscle cells
		* leading to vascular smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation. 
	* endothelia cells are obligatory in the relaxation of vascular smooth muscle by ACh

## Summary 

* The direct-acting acetylcholine receptor agonists include choline esters (e.g., [bethanechol](#/22)) and plant alkaloids (e.g., [pilocarpine](#/24)). <span id="drug"> Pilocarpine </span>  is used to treat glaucoma and dry mouth.
* The cholinesterase inhibitors indirectly activate acetylcholine receptors by increasing the synaptic concentration of acetylcholine. These drugs have both parasympathomimetic and somatic nervous system effects.
* The reversible cholinesterase inhibitors include [edrophonium](#/33), which is used to diagnose myasthenia gravis, and [neostigmine and pyridostigmine](#/34) , which are used to treat myasthenia gravis.
* The quasi-reversible cholinesterase inhibitors are organophosphate compounds that are widely used as pesticides and less commonly used in medical therapy. [Echothiophate](#/35) can be used to treat ocular conditions, whereas [malathion](#/35) is used to treat pediculosis.
* Organophosphate toxicity is treated with atropine and a cholinesterase regenerator called [pralidoxime](#/35).
* [Sildenafil](#/36) and related drugs inhibit the degradation of cGMP by 5-PDE and thereby potentiate the vasodilative action of nitric oxide in the penis and other tissues. These drugs are used to treat male erectile dysfunction.
