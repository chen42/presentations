## Where is Acetylcholine?

![](./images/cholinergic/where_is_ach.png) 

---

## Acetylcholine

* Central nervous system 
	* Excitatory actions
	* Cortex, basal ganglia, spinal cord, many others (both nicotinic and muscarinic) 

* Peripheral nervous system 
	* Activates skeletal muscles (nicotinic) 
	* All *pregaglionic* autonomic (both parasympathetic and sypathetic) (nicotinic) 
	* All *postganglionic* <b>parasympathetic</b> and sympathetic to sweat gland and some blood vellels (muscarinic)

## Major groups of cholinergic agonists 

![](http://accessmedicine.mhmedical.com/data/books/1193/m_kat_ch7_f001.png)


---

## Direct-acting agonists


<b>cholinomimetics</b> 

Bind and activate acetylcholine receptors (think muscarinic)

* Choline esters
	* <span id="drug"> Acetylcholine Methacholine Bethanechol Carbachol </span> 
* Plant alkaloids
	* <span id="drug"> Muscarine Nicotine Pilocarpine </span> 	
* Synthetic 
	* <span id="drug"> Cevimeline Varenicline </span> 

---

## Cholinomimetics: ADME 
* choline esters are *not* distributed to the CNS 
* they are hydrolized in the GI tract, especially <span id="drug"> acetylcholine</span>. Others are more resistant.
* poorly absorbed from the GI tract
* <span id="drug"> Acetylcholine </span> and <span id="drug"> carbachol </span> activate both muscarinic and nicotinic receptors
* <span id="drug"> Methacholine </span> and <span id="drug"> Bethanechol </span> activates only muscarinic receptors (due to the CH3 group) but are not subtype-specific.

Cholinomimetics: Organ system effects 

### Ocular effects 
<div id="left50">
<ul>
<li> Increase lacrimal glad secretions
<p>
<li> Stimulate the contraction of the iris sphincter muscle and the ciliary muscle ([Miosis](http://www.e-safe-anaesthesia.org/sessions/15_05/gif/ana_1_011_autonomic_nervous_system_08_t1_01_med.gif) and [accommondation](http://www.eyecairo.net/images/accommodation_1.gif))

Cholinomimetics: Organ system effects 

### Cardiac effects 


* Muscarinic agonists 
	* reduce the heart rate, with a *but*
		* high dose ACh cause bradycardia, decrease atriventricular node conduction velocity
		* low dose ACh i.v. infusion reduces blood pressure, which increases heart rate (homeostatic reflex)

---

Cholinomimetics: Organ system effects 

### Vascular effects 

* <span id="drug"> Acetylcholine </span> typically causes vasodilation. 
	* mediated by activating muscarinic M3 receptors located in vascular endothelial cells 
		* activation of nitric oxide (NO) synthetase. 
		* NO diffuses into vascular smooth muscle cells
		* leading to vascular smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation. 
	* endothelia cells are obligatory in the relaxation of vascular smooth muscle by ACh
	* coronary arteriolar response to ACh the same way. But if the endothelium is damaged by atherosclerosis, ACh causes vasoconstriction.

## Summary 

* The direct-acting acetylcholine receptor agonists include choline esters (e.g., [bethanechol](#/22)) and plant alkaloids (e.g., [pilocarpine](#/24)). <span id="drug"> Pilocarpine </span> is used to treat glaucoma and dry mouth.
* The cholinesterase inhibitors indirectly activate acetylcholine receptors by increasing the synaptic concentration of acetylcholine. These drugs have both parasympathomimetic and somatic nervous system effects.
* The reversible cholinesterase inhibitors include [edrophonium](#/33), which is used to diagnose myasthenia gravis, and [neostigmine and pyridostigmine](#/34) , which are used to treat myasthenia gravis.
* The quasi-reversible cholinesterase inhibitors are organophosphate compounds that are widely used as pesticides and less commonly used in medical therapy. [Echothiophate](#/36) can be used to treat ocular conditions, whereas [malathion](#/36) is used to treat pediculosis.
* Organophosphate toxicity is treated with atropine and a cholinesterase regenerator called [pralidoxime](#/37).
* [Sildenafil](#/38) and related drugs inhibit the degradation of cGMP by 5-PDE and thereby potentiate the vasodilative action of nitric oxide in the penis and other tissues. These drugs are used to treat male erectile dysfunction.
