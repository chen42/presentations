## Cholinergic receptors

<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3238081/figure/fig2/"><img src="./images/cholinergic/mnAChR.png"></a>

<small>Each mAChR subtype is a seven-transmembrane protein, which belongs to two major functional classes based on G-protein coupling. The M1, M3, and M5 mAChRs selectively couple to the Gq/G11-type G-proteins resulting in the generation of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) through activation of the phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase-C&beta; leading to increased intracellular calcium levels. The M2 and M4 mAChRs preferentially activate Gi/Go-type G-proteins, thereby inhibiting adenylate cyclase, reducing intracellular concentration of cAMP, and prolonging potassium channel opening. Neuronal nAChRs are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels. The most abundant neuronal subunits are &alpha;4, &beta;2, and &alpha;7, with the heteromeric &alpha;4&beta;2 receptor subtype in highest abundance. </small>

## mAChR subtypes

<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3238081/figure/fig1/"><img src="./images/cholinergic/Ach_synapse.png" width=70%></a>
<small>
The M2 and M4 mAChRs serve as autoreceptors on cholinergic terminals to suppress ACh release at select synapses in the CNS (left neuron). <font color="darkblue">The mAChRs located on non-cholinergic neurons act as heteroceptors controlling the release of other neurotransmitters, such as Dopamine. (not draw) </font> M1, M3, M5, but also M4 mAChRs that are located postsynaptically facilitate slow cholinergic synaptic neurotransmission relative to nAChR subtypes. The alpha7 and alpha4beta2 nAChR subtypes mediate fast synaptic transmission and also use-dependent changes required for neuronal plasticity. These nAChR subtypes can have both pre- and postsynaptic localization. </small>

// Note: The endogenous ligand of these cholinergic receptors, ACh, is synthesized in cholinergic neurons (left neuron) by the enzyme ChAT through the transfer of acetyl-CoA onto choline. Choline uptake is mediated by presynaptic high-affinity choline transporters (ChT). After synthesis, ACh is packaged into synaptic vesicles by the vesicular ACh transporter (vAChT). After neuronal activation-mediated release into the synaptic cleft, ACh can bind to pre- and postsynaptic receptors, or it can be inactivated through hydrolysis by the AChE enzymes, a process that can be inhibited by different substances (eg, organophosphates, AChE inhibitors) to increase synaptic ACh levels. Once ACh is hydrolyzed, choline is transported through the ChTs into the presynaptic terminal, where it is again synthesized into ACh.

## Antimuscarinics: ADME

* Absorption 
	* tertiary antimuscarinic drugs are well absorbed
	* quaternary antimuscarinic drugs are not well absorbed 
* Distribution 
	* tertiary antimuscarinics are widely distributed in the body.
		* Significant levels are achieved in the CNS within 30 minutes to 1 hour.
	* quaternary derivatives are poorly taken up by the brain and therefore are relatively free of CNS effects.
* Metabolism 
	* the elimination of <span id="drug"> atropine </span> from the blood occurs in two phases: the t1/2 of the rapid phase is 2 hours and that of the slow phase is approximately 13 hours. 
	* Effect on parasympathetic function declines rapidly in all organs except the eye, where it can persist for &gt; 72 hours.
* Excretion 
	* About 50% of the dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. The rest appears in the urine as hydrolysis and conjugation products.

## Summary of Important Points

* Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists relax smooth muscle, increase heart rate and cardiac conduction, and inhibit exocrine gland secretion. They include belladonna alkaloids (e.g., [atropine and scopolamine](#/scopolamine)) and semisynthetic and synthetic drugs (e.g., [ipratropium](#/ipratropium)).
* Muscarinic blockers are used to treat [bradycardia](#/bradycardia), [obstructive lung diseases](#/ipratropium), [intestinal spasms](#/intestinal), and [overactive urinary bladder](#/urinary). They are also used to [reduce salivary and respiratory secretions](#/glycopyrrolate) and to [produce mydriasis and cycloplegia](#/tropicamide).
* <span id="drug"> Atropine </span> [toxicity](#/toxicity) can cause dryness of the mouth and skin, blurred vision, tachycardia, palpitations, urinary retention, delirium, and hallucinations.
* Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists include nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents known as curariform drugs, such as [rocuronium](#/nondepol) and [cisatracurium](#/nondepol). These drugs are used to produce muscle relaxation during surgery.
* Curariform drugs competitively block nicotinic receptors in skeletal muscle. They do not cause muscle fasciculations, and their effects can be reversed by cholinesterase inhibitors or [Sugammadex](#/sugammadex) .
* [Succinylcholine](#/succinylcholine) is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent with a short duration of action. It produces muscle fasciculations that are followed by muscle paralysis. Its effects are not reversed by cholinesterase inhibitors.
