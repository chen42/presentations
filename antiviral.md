### AIDS background

1. **Primary infection.** About 90% of patients develop a flu-like illness, which coincides with [seroconversion](https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/education-materials/glossary/648/seroconversion), between 2 and 4 weeks post exposure. Symptoms include, fever, night sweats, sore throat, lymphadenopathy, diarrhea. The illness is self-limiting.
2. **Asymptomatic phase.** Of variable duration, from 2 to 10 years. Patients are clinically well, but infectious.
3. **Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS).** Features:
	* Constitutional disease: 
		* fever, diarrhea, weight loss, skin rashes.
	* Neurological disease:
		* [dementia](https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/education-materials/glossary/21/aids-dementia-complex), [myelopathy](https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/education-materials/glossary/3303/vacuolar-myelopathy), [peripheral neuropathy](https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/education-materials/glossary/563/peripheral-neuropathy).
	* Immunodeficiency: 
		* increased susceptibility to [opportunistic infections]( https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/education-materials/glossary/531/opportunistic-infection).
	* Rare malignancies:
		* [Kaposi sarcoma](https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/education-materials/glossary/531/opportunistic-infection), [oral hairy leukoplakia](https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/education-materials/glossary/532/oral-hairy-leukoplakia), or [lymphoma](https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/education-materials/glossary/435/lymphoma).

#### The Initiation of Antiretroviral Therapy 

Last updated January 28, 2016

* Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is recommended for all HIV-infected individuals, regardless of CD4 T lymphocyte cell count, to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection (AI) and to
 prevent HIV transmission (AI).
* On a case-by-case basis, ART may be deferred because of clinical and/or psychosocial factors, but therapy should be initiated as soon as possible.

<small>Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional </small>
