## Cholinomimetics: MoA 

![](./images/cholinergic/moa_choline.png)
<small>
<b>Muscarinic and nicotinic signaling. A:</b> Muscarinic transmission to the sinoatrial node in heart. Acetylcholine (ACh) released from a varicosity of a postganglionic cholinergic axon interacts with a sinoatrial node cell muscarinic receptor (M2R) linked via Gi/o to K+ channel opening, which causes hyperpolarization, and to inhibition of cAMP synthesis. Released ACh also acts on an axonal muscarinic receptor (autoreceptor) to cause inhibition of ACh release (autoinhibition). B: Nicotinic transmission at the skeletal neuromuscular junction. ACh released from the motor nerve terminal interacts with subunits of the pentameric nicotinic receptor to open it, allowing Na+ influx to produce an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP). The EPSP depolarizes the muscle membrane, generating an action potential, and triggering contraction. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the extracellular matrix hydrolyzes ACh. See [textbook](https://accessmedicine.mhmedical.com/content.aspx?bookid=1193&sectionid=69104334#kat13_ch7fg4) for more details.

Cholinomimetics: Organ system effects 

### Vascular effects 

* <span id="drug"> Acetylcholine </span> *typically* causes vasodilation. 
	* mediated by activating muscarinic M3 receptors located in vascular [endothelial cells](http://www.lab.anhb.uwa.edu.au/mb140/corepages/vascular/Images/VesWall.jpg) 
		* activation of nitric oxide (NO) synthetase. 
		* NO diffuses into vascular smooth muscle cells
		* leading to vascular smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation. 
	* endothelia cells are obligatory in the relaxation of vascular smooth muscle by ACh
	* coronary arteriolar response to ACh the same way. *If the endothelium is damaged by atherosclerosis, ACh causes vasoconstriction* by activating the smooth muscle cells directly.

// NA; noradrenaline, Ach, Wash, drug addiction and cummulative concentration with flow.
direct effect of Ach on vascular smoothe muscle is contraction

the endothelium contains the enzymes necessary to synthesize, store and breakdown ACh.  flow‐mediated endothelial calcium responses arise from the autocrine action of non‐neuronal ACh released by the endothelium. [link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5157078/)

## Indirect-acting agonists

![](http://accessmedicine.mhmedical.com/data/books/1193/m_kat_ch7_f006.png)


<small>Cholinesterase inhibitors. Neostigmine exemplifies the typical ester composed of carbamic acid ([1]) and a phenol bearing a quaternary ammonium group ([2]). Physostigmine, a naturally occurring carbamate, is a tertiary amine. Edrophonium is not an ester but binds to the active site of the enzyme. Carbaryl is used as an insecticide. See [textbook](https://accessmedicine.mhmedical.com/content.aspx?bookid=1193&sectionid=69104334#1104841671) Figure 7-6 for details </small>

##	Summary 

*	The direct-acting acetylcholine receptor agonists include choline esters (e.g., [bethanechol](#/24)) and plant alkaloids (e.g., [pilocarpine](#/26)). <span id="drug"> Pilocarpine </span> is used to treat glaucoma and dry mouth.
*	The cholinesterase inhibitors indirectly activate acetylcholine receptors by increasing the synaptic concentration of acetylcholine. These drugs have both parasympathomimetic and somatic nervous system effects.
*	The reversible cholinesterase inhibitors include [edrophonium](#/35), which is used to diagnose myasthenia gravis, and [neostigmine and pyridostigmine](#/36), which are used to treat myasthenia gravis.
*	The quasi-reversible cholinesterase inhibitors are organophosphate compounds that are widely used as pesticides and less commonly used in medical therapy. [Echothiophate](#/38) can be used to treat ocular conditions, whereas [malathion](#/38) is used to treat pediculosis.
*	Organophosphate toxicity is treated with atropine and a cholinesterase regenerator called [pralidoxime](#/39).
*	[Sildenafil](#/41) and related drugs inhibit the degradation of cGMP by 5-PDE and thereby potentiate the vasodilative action of nitric oxide in the penis and other tissues. These drugs are used to treat male erectile dysfunction.
