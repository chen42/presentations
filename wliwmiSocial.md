## Experiment design

* Animals: young adult WMI (6F, 6M)  and WLI (6F, 6M) 
* Housing condition: three per cage (same sex, same strain)
* Test arena: circular 
* Video recording: 1080p 30fps, 15 min, room light was on 
* Day 1: cage mates 
	* social interaction among familiar rats
* Day 2: each rat is paired with an unfamilar Long Evans rat of the same sex
* Day 3: repeat day 2, but with a different unfamilar Long Evans rat 
	* Day 2/3 was social interaction with unfamiliar rats
