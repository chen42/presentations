## Cholinergic receptors

<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3238081/figure/fig2/"><img src="./images/cholinergic/mnAChR.png"></a>

The structure and signaling pathways of mAChRs and nAChRs. Each mAChR subtype is a seven-transmembrane protein, which belongs to two major functional classes based on G-protein coupling. The M1, M3, and M5 mAChRs selectively couple to the Gq/G11-type G-proteins resulting in the generation of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) through activation of the phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase-C&beta; leading to increased intracellular calcium levels. The M2 and M4 mAChRs preferentially activate Gi/Go-type G-proteins, thereby inhibiting adenylate cyclase, reducing intracellular concentration of cAMP, and prolonging potassium channel opening. Neuronal nAChRs are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels. The most abundant neuronal subunits are &alpha;4, &beta;2, and &alpha;7, with the heteromeric &alpha;4&beta;2 receptor subtype in highest abundance.

## mAChR subtypes

<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3238081/figure/fig1/"><img src="./images/cholinergic/Ach_synapse.png" with=70%></a>

The M2 and M4 mAChRs serve as autoreceptors on cholinergic terminals to suppress ACh release and inhibit cholinergic neurotransmission at select synapses in the central nervous system (left neuron). <font color="blue">The mAChRs located on non-cholinergic neurons act as heteroceptors controlling the release of other neurotransmitters, such as Dopamine. (not draw) </font> M1, M3, M5, but also M4 mAChRs that are located postsynaptically facilitate slow cholinergic synaptic neurotransmission relative to nAChR subtypes. The alpha7 and alpha4beta2 nAChR subtypes mediate fast synaptic transmission and also use-dependent changes required for neuronal plasticity. These nAChR subtypes can have both pre- and postsynaptic localization. 

Note: The endogenous ligand of these cholinergic receptors, ACh, is synthesized in cholinergic neurons (left neuron) by the enzyme ChAT through the transfer of acetyl-CoA onto choline. Choline uptake is mediated by presynaptic high-affinity choline transporters (ChT). After synthesis, ACh is packaged into synaptic vesicles by the vesicular ACh transporter (vAChT). After neuronal activation-mediated release into the synaptic cleft, ACh can bind to pre- and postsynaptic receptors, or it can be inactivated through hydrolysis by the AChE enzymes, a process that can be inhibited by different substances (eg, organophosphates, AChE inhibitors) to increase synaptic ACh levels. Once ACh is hydrolyzed, choline is transported through the ChTs into the presynaptic terminal, where it is again synthesized into ACh.

* Absorption 
	* tertiary antimuscarinic drugs are well absorbed
	* quaternary antimuscarinic drugs are not well absorbed [organic chemistry](http://11452-presscdn-0-51.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/4-1234.png)
* Distribution 
	* tertiary antimuscarinics are widely distributed in the body.
		* Significant levels are achieved in the CNS within 30 minutes to 1 hour.
	* quaternary derivatives are poorly taken up by the brain and therefore are relatively free of CNS effects.
* Metabolism 
	* the elimination of <span id="drug"> atropine </span> from the blood occurs in two phases: the t1/2 of the rapid phase is 2 hours and that of the slow phase is approximately 13 hours. 
* Excretion 
	* About 50% of the dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. The rest appears in the urine as hydrolysis and conjugation products. 
	* Effect on parasympathetic function declines rapidly in all organs except the eye, where it can persist for &gt; 72 hours.

## Semisynthetic and Synthetic Muscarinic Receptor Antagonists

the pharmacologic effects of these agents are similar to those of atropine, their unique pharmacokinetic properties are advantageous in specific situations. 


---
<section id="ipratropium">
## <span id="drug"> Ipratropium, Tiotropium </span> 

quaternary amine derivatives of atropine, are administered by inhalation to patients with obstructive lung diseases. Because these drugs are not well absorbed from the lungs into the systemic circulation, they produce few adverse effects. For example, unlike atropine, they do not impair the ciliary clearance of secretions from the airways. This makes them particularly useful in treating patients with asthma, emphysema, and chronic bronchitis. The respiratory effects and uses of these compounds are discussed more thoroughly in Chapter 27 . 

* main difference  is duration of action. 
	* Tiotropium once daily dosing
	* ipratropium requires four times daily dosing

## <span id="drug"> Dicyclomine, Oxybutynin, Solifenacin, </span> and Related Drugs

Dicyclomine is a synthetic amine used to relax intestinal smooth muscle and thereby relieve irritable bowel symptoms, such as intestinal cramping. Oxybutynin, tolterodine, darifenacin, solifenacin, and trospium are used to reduce the four major symptoms of overactive bladder: daytime urinary frequency, nocturia (frequent urination at night), urgency, and incontinence. Oxybutynin is now available in both oral and topical (gel) formulations. Compared with other muscarinic receptor antagonists, darifenacin, solifenacin, tolterodine, and trospium appear to have a more selective action on the urinary bladder and may cause fewer adverse effects such as dry mouth and blurred vision. These uroselective blockers are administered once or twice daily.

## Nondepolarizing Neuromuscular Blocking Agents 
### ADME 
* <b>curariform drugs</b>, <span id="drug"> atracurium, cisatracurium, pancuronium, rocuronium, </span> and <span id="drug"> vecuronium </span>. 
* <span id="drug"> tubocurarine </span>, was extracted from plants used by native South Americans as arrow poisons for hunting wild game. 
	* The curariform drugs are not well absorbed from the gut.
* administered only by the intravenous route.
* most eliminated by renal and biliary excretion of the unchanged compounds 
	* or hepatic metabolites
* most of the isomers of atracurium are hydrolyzed by plasma esterases. 
* <span id="drug"> cisatracurium </span> spontaneously decomposes by nonenzymatic chemical degradation. 
	* preferred paralytic agent for critically ill patients with impaired hepatic and renal function. 
* In patients with normal renal and hepatic function, atracurium and cisatracurium have an intermediate duration of action comparable to that of vecuronium and rocuronium.

Nicotinic Receptor Antagonists 
## Nondepolarizing Neuromuscular Blocking Agents 
### MoA 

* competitive antagonists of nAChR in skeletal muscle
	* sequence of muscle paralyzing effect 
		1. the small and rapidly moving muscles of the eyes and face
		2. the larger muscles of the limbs and trunk
		3. the intercostal muscles and diaphragm, causing respiration to cease. 
		4. it enables relaxation of abdominal muscles for surgical procedures without producing apnea. 
		5. respiratory function should always be closely monitored
* stimulate the release of histamine from mast cells, and they block autonomic ganglia and muscarinic receptors.
	* cause bronchospasm, hypotension, and tachycardia. 
	* Newer drugs tend to cause less histamine release and fewer autonomic side effects than does <span id="drug"> pancuronium </span>.

Nicotinic Receptor Antagonists 
## Nondepolarizing Neuromuscular Blocking Agents 
### Interactions

muscle-relaxing effects are potentiated by volatile inhalational anesthetic agents (e.g., <span id="drug"> sevoflurane</span> ) and by the aminoglycoside antibiotics, tetracycline antibiotics, and calcium channel blockers. 
* effects is more pronounced in myasthenia gravis patients.
* reversed by administering a cholinesterase inhibitor (e.g., <span id="drug"> neostigmine </span>). [Neostigmine reversal](http://chen42.github.io/talks/cho_ag.html#/33) 
* <span id="drug"> sugammadex</span> reverse steroidal neuromuscular blocking agents such as </span> rocuronium </span>. <span id="drug"> Sugammadex </span>  forms a tight water-soluble complex with <span id="drug"> rocuronium </span>  and removes the drug from the neuromuscular junction
	* producing a fast recovery of neuromuscular function and reducing the risk of postoperative respiratory dysfunction. 
	* [FDA approval in Dec 15, 2015](https://www.fda.gov/newsevents/newsroom/pressannouncements/ucm477512.htm)

<section id="succinylcholine">
Nicotinic Receptor Antagonists 
###  Depolarizing Neuromuscular Blocking Agents
<span id="drug"> Succinylcholine</span> 

* ADME and MoA 
	* the only depolarizing agent available for clinical use today
	* composed of two covalently linked molecules of acetylcholine.
	* succinylcholine binds to nAChR in skeletal muscle.
	* when the drug is first administered, it produces transient muscle contractions called fasciculations, followed by a sustained muscle paralysis. 
	* <span id="drug"> succinylcholine </span> is  hydrolyzed  by cholinesterase (slower than ACh). 
* Indication 
	* short duration
	* the preferred neuromuscular blocker for adults with emergency airway situations.
	* potients with  atypical cholinesterase cannot metabolize <span id="drug"> succinylcholine </span> at normal rates 
		* susceptible to prolonged neuromuscular paralysis and apnea

Nicotinic Receptor Antagonists 
###  Depolarizing Neuromuscular Blocking Agents
<span id="drug"> Succinylcholine</span> 

* Interactions and adverse effects
	* malignant hyperthermia:  pharmacogenetic disorder of skeletal muscle that presents as a hypermetabolic response to anesthetic gases *or* <span id="drug"> Succinylcholine</span>
	* The classic signs of MH include hyperthermia, tachycardia, tachypnea, increased carbon dioxide production, increased oxygen consumption, acidosis, hyperkalaemia, muscle rigidity, and rhabdomyolysis, all related to a hypermetabolic response.
	* In most cases, the syndrome is caused by a defect in the ryanodine receptor.  
	* Likely fatal if untreated. Mortality has decreased from 80 % thirty years ago to <5 % in 2006.
	* <span id="drug"> Dantrolene </span>  is a specific treatment for MH. 
		* decrease muscle contraction by directly [interfering with calcium ion release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum](https://www.clinicalkey.com/#!/content/drug_monograph/6-s2.0-167) within skeletal muscle cells.

## Poison

* other
	* prevent muscarinic side effects when cholinesterase inhibitors are given to patients with myasthenia gravis.
	* reverse the muscarinic effects of cholinesterase inhibitor overdose. 
		* supranormal doses may be required to counteract the large concentrations of acetylcholine that have accumulated at acetylcholine synapses
		* <span id="drug"> atropine</span>  dosage must be titrated to the patient's response. 
		* <span id="drug"> Atropine</span>  and <span id="drug"> glycopyrrolate </span>  will not counteract the effects of nicotinic receptor activation caused by cholinesterase inhibition. 
			* The muscle weakness resulting from nicotinic receptor stimulation can be attenuated by adding <span id="drug">   pralidoxime </span>  to the treatment regimen.

## Summary of Important Points


* Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists relax smooth muscle, increase heart rate and cardiac conduction, and inhibit exocrine gland secretion. They include belladonna alkaloids (e.g., [atropine and scopolamine](#/scopolamine)) and semisynthetic and synthetic drugs (e.g., [ipratropium](#/ipratropium)).
* Muscarinic blockers are used to treat bradycardia, obstructive lung diseases, intestinal spasms, and overactive urinary bladder. They are also used to reduce salivary and respiratory secretions and to produce mydriasis and cycloplegia.
* <span id="drug"> Atropine </span> [toxicity](#/toxicity) can cause dryness of the mouth and skin, blurred vision, tachycardia, palpitations, urinary retention, delirium, and hallucinations.
* Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists include nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents known as curariform drugs, such as [rocuronium](#/nondepol) and  [cisatracurium](#/nondepol). These drugs are used to produce muscle relaxation during surgery.
* Curariform drugs competitively block nicotinic receptors in skeletal muscle. They do not cause muscle fasciculations, and their effects can be reversed by cholinesterase inhibitors.

* [Succinylcholine](#/succinylcholine) is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent with a short duration of action. It produces muscle fasciculations that are followed by muscle paralysis. Its effects are not reversed by cholinesterase inhibitors.
