### AIDS background

1. **Primary infection.** About 90% of patients develop a flu-like illness, which coincides with seroconversion, between 2 and 4 weeks post exposure. Symptoms include, fever, night sweats, sore throat, lymphadenopathy, diarrhea. The illness is self-limiting.
2. **Asymptomatic phase.** Of variable duration, from 2 to 10 years. Patients are clinically well, but infectious.
3. **Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS).** Syndrome with the following features:
	* Constitutional disease: fever, diarrhea, weight loss, skin rashes.
	* Neurological disease: dementia, myelopathy, peripheral neuropathy.
	* Immunodeficiency: increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections.
	* Rare malignancies: Kaposi sarcoma, oral hairy leukoplakia, lymphomas.

### Current treatment guideline 

#### Initiation of Antiretroviral Therapy 
[Last updated January 28, 2016](https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/guidelines/html/1/adult-and-adolescent-treatment-guidelines/0/)

* Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is recommended for all HIV-infected individuals, regardless of CD4 T lymphocyte cell count, to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection (AI) and to
 prevent HIV transmission (AI).
* On a case-by-case basis, ART may be deferred because of clinical and/or psychosocial factors, but therapy should be initiated as soon as possible.
