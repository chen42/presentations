## Learning Objectives

* List the locations of and the differences between muscarinic and nicotinic receptors.

---

## Learning Objectives 

* Discuss the therapeutic uses and side effects of muscarinic agonists and anticholinesterases. 
	* Explain the differences in onset and duration of action and route of administration for different groups of anticholinesterases
	* Explain why anticholinesterase agents can be used as insecticides (malathion, parathion) and chemical warfare agents (sarin, VX series).

## Where is Acetylcholine?

![](./images/cholinergic/where_is_ach.png) 

---

## Acetylcholine

* Central nervous system 
	* Excitatory actions
	* Cortex, basal ganglia, spinal cord, many others (both nicotinic and muscarinic) 

* Peripheral nervous system 
	* Activates skeletal muscles (nicotinic) 
	* All *pregaglionic* autonomic (both parasympathetic and sypathetic) (nicotinic) 
	* All *postganglionic* <b>parasympathetic</b> and sympathetic to sweat gland and some blood vellels (muscarinic)

##  Choline esters: ADME 
<div id="left50">
<p>
<ul>
<li> poorly absorbed from the GI tract
<p>
<li> *not* distributed to the CNS 
<p>
<li> hydrolized in the GI tract, especially  <span id="drug"> acetylcholine</span>. Others are more resistant.
	
<p>
<li><span id="drug">  Acetylcholine </span>  and <span id="drug"> carbachol </span>  activate both muscarinic and nicotinic receptors

<p>
<li><span id="drug"> Methacholine and Bethanechol  </span> activates only muscarinic receptors (due to the CH3 group) but not subtype  specific.

Choline esters: Orang system effects 

### Ocular effects 
<div id="left50">
<ul>
<li> Increase lacrimal glad secretions
<li> Stimulate the contraction of the iris sphincter muscle and the ciliary muscle (Miosis and accommondation) 
<li> Facilitate outflow of [aqueous humor](https://www.aao.org/eye-health/anatomy/aqueous-humor) (reduce [IOP](https://www.aao.org/bcscsnippetdetail.aspx?id=f010bbf6-3f3e-486b-b5cd-0ad86ddb9d74))

Choline esters: Orang system effects 

### Cardiac effects  

* Muscarinic agonists 
	* reduces the rate of diastolic depolarization
		*  reduce the heart rate
	*  slow conduction of the cardiac action potential
		* increase PR interval 

---

Choline esters: Orang system effects 

### Vascular effects  

* <span id="drug"> Acetylcholine </span>  typically causes vasodilation. 
	* mediated by activating muscarinic M3 receptors located in vascular endothelial cells 
		* activation of nitric oxide (NO) synthetase. 
		* NO diffuses into vascular smooth muscle cells
		* leading to vascular smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation.

Choline esters: Orang system effects 

### Respiratory Tract Effects 

* Muscarinic agonists
	* increases bronchial muscle contraction
	* causes an increase in the secretion of mucus throughout the respiratory tract. 
	* contra-indicated in patients with asthma and other forms of obstructive lung disease.

Choline esters: Orang system effects 

### Gastrointestinal and Urinary Tract Effects 
* Muscarinic receptor agonists
	* stimulate salivary, gastric, and other secretions in the gastrointestinal tract.
	* 	increase contraction of GI smooth muscle (except sphincters)
		* 	by stimulating the enteric nervous system
	* increases gastrointestinal motility. 
	---
	* stimulate the [bladder detrusor muscle](http://img.medscapestatic.com/pi/meds/ckb/21/12721.jpg), they *relax* the internal sphincter of the bladder 
	* promote emptying of the bladder (micturition). 
	* higher doses produce excessive salivation and cause diarrhea, intestinal cramps, and urinary incontinence (the "all faucets turned on" syndrome). 

---

* Indirect-acting agonists 
	* increase the synaptic concentration of acetylcholine by inhibiting cholinesterase
	* augment acetylcholine signal transduction
