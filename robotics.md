  * you can compare the differences between versions
* basic concepts 
  * branch: master/testing/experimenting
  * **fork**: copy other people's code and make that *your own* 
    * for the purpose of  **modify** it 
    * usually done on github.com
  * **clone**: copy remote code to your local computer  
    * for the purpose of **using** it 
    * usually done on your computer
* basic commands 

```
   git init ## starting a new repo
   git clone ## get someone else's code
   git add this_file # I changed this_file, or I want to save a new file
   git commit -m "I am just starting" # I am saving this with a comment
   git push origin master # up to the cloud
   git pull # get the latest from the cloud
