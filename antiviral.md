### AIDS background

1. **Primary infection.** About 90% of patients develop a flu-like illness, which coincides with [seroconversion](https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/education-materials/glossary/648/seroconversion), between 2 and 4 weeks post exposure. Symptoms include, fever, night sweats, sore throat, lymphadenopathy, diarrhea. The illness is self-limiting.
2. **Asymptomatic phase.** Of variable duration, from 2 to 10 years. Patients are clinically well, but infectious.
3. **Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS).** Features:
	* Constitutional disease: 
		* fever, diarrhea, weight loss, skin rashes.
	* Neurological disease:
		* [dementia](https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/education-materials/glossary/21/aids-dementia-complex), [myelopathy](https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/education-materials/glossary/3303/vacuolar-myelopathy), [peripheral neuropathy](https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/education-materials/glossary/563/peripheral-neuropathy).
	* Immunodeficiency: 
		* increased susceptibility to [opportunistic infections]( https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/education-materials/glossary/531/opportunistic-infection).
	* Rare malignancies:
		* [Kaposi sarcoma](https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/education-materials/glossary/531/opportunistic-infection), [oral hairy leukoplakia](https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/education-materials/glossary/532/oral-hairy-leukoplakia), or [lymphoma](https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/education-materials/glossary/435/lymphoma).

#### The Initiation of Antiretroviral Therapy 

Last updated January 28, 2016

* Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is recommended for all HIV-infected individuals, regardless of CD4 T lymphocyte cell count, to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection (AI) and to
 prevent HIV transmission (AI).
* On a case-by-case basis, ART may be deferred because of clinical and/or psychosocial factors, but therapy should be initiated as soon as possible.

<small>Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional </small>

### Protease Inhibitors
* Indications
	* Treatment of HIV as part of combination therapy
	* Most effective ART available
	* Effective in both acutely and chronic HIV-1 infected cells
	* Effective in monocytes and macrophages 
		* Not affected by RT inhibitors
	* Early stages of HIV-1 replication cycle not affected
* Mechanism of Action
	* Selective, competitive inhibitors of HIV proteases
	* Bind reversibly to protease active site
	* Prevent cleavage of polyprotein and block viral maturation
* Resistance
	* Each drug selects for different mutations in protease gene at level of specific codons
 
---
### Protease inhibitors

* ADME
	* Oral absorption varies
	* Bind extensively to plasma proteins
	* Metabolized by cytochrome P-450 system
		* Concurrent use of potent P-450 inducer (e.g. <span id="drug"> rifampin </span> ) leads to decreased PI concentration
	* Renal excretion is minimal
		* No adjustments needed for renal dysfunctions
	* Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4
		* <span id="drug"> Ritonavir </span> used to increase (i.e. "boost")  plasma concentration of other PIs except <span id="drug"> nelfinavir </span> 
		* Toxic adverse effects related to drug accumulation due to PI-mediated inhibition of hepatic P450 system

Abbreviation: AUC, area under plasma concentration-time curve; t1/2elim, half-life of elimination; &uarr;, increase; &darr;, decrease;, CYP, cytochrome P450.
Saquinavir data refer to soft-gel capsule formulation
\*Lopinavir refers to coformulation with ritonavir

### Protease inhibitors
#### Drug interactions 

* <span id="drug"> Carbamazepine</span> 
	* (treat epilepsy) lower <span id="drug"> indinavir </span> AUC and potentially other PIs
* <span id="drug"> Ketoconazole </span> 
	* (antifugal) upregulates PIs AUC
* <span id="drug"> Sildenafil </span> 
	* (vasodilator) AUC augmented by PIs
* <span id="drug"> Methadone </span>
	* (addiction treatment) AUC reduced by <span id="drug"> ritonavir / lopinavir </span> 
* Oral contraceptive AUC reduced by PIs
	* <span id="drug"> Indinavir </span> is exception

### Protease inhibitors
#### Common Adverse Effects
* Hyperlipidemia 
	* May be more dramatic with <span id="drug"> ritonavir </span> due to interference in lipid metabolism. 
* Insulin resistance and diabetes
* Lipodystrophy
	* redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement ([buffalo hump](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10509567)), peripheral wasting, accumulation of facial fat, lipomas, breast enlargement, [gynecomastia](http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gynecomastia/home/ovc-20257576)
* Elevated liver function tests
* Possible increased bleeding risk in [hemophilics](https://www-clinicalkey-com.ezproxy.uthsc.edu/#!/content/medical_topic/21-s2.0-1014697)

### Protease inhibitors
#### Specific Adverse Effects 
* Ritonavir 
	* Hepatotoxicity at high doses
* Indinavir
	* [Nephrolithiasis/urolithiasis](https://www-clinicalkey-com.ezproxy.uthsc.edu/#!/content/book/3-s2.0-B9780323280488008241):  patients should drink 2 liters/day

### Darunavir

* Achieves faster virologic response than control PIs. 
* Can be used to treat patients resist to other PIs. 
* Must be used in combination in an antiviral regimen.
	* requires an enhancer (i.e. low does <span id="drug"> ritonavir </span> )  
* Recommended for treatment-naive patients

### PIs in brief

* Indications
	* Treatment of HIV infection as part of combination therapy
* Mechanism of act 
	* Inhibition of HIV protease
* Resistance
	* Mutations of the protease gene 
		*	<span id="drug"> Indinavir, ritonavir </span> and <span id="drug"> lopinavir </span>  require more mutations than other PIs
* ADME
	* Poor systemic bioavailability
	* All PIs metabolized in liver by P450 enzymes
* Adverse effects
	* GI distress, diarrhea and vomiting
	* Increase bleeding hemophilia A or B
	* Hyperglycemia, insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia
	* Fat wasting, reaccumulation, and redistribution -- lipodystropy
* Drug interactions
	* Can be severe due to effects on P450 enzymes

### Antiretroviral Drug Selectivity

* NRTIs
	* Once phosphorylated by cellular kinases have greater affinity for viral reverse transcriptase than for cellular DNA polymerases.
* NNRTIs
	* Do not undergo phosphorylation
	* Have greater affinity for viral reverse transcriptase than for cellular DNA polymerases
* PIs
	* Greater affinity for HIV aspartyl protease than for human protease.
